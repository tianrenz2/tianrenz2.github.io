## __Special: A Mobile Game: Star Gazing (Chinese Name: 星云穿梭)__   <br/>
Star Gazing is a free and fun mobile game made with Unity, it is available on both Google play and App store RIGHT NOW!<br/><br/>
I started this project with some friends at UCI when we were attending the Global Game Jam 2019. We initially made a sample of this game just for that event, but as we realized this game was actually pretty fun and there could be a lot to extend, we started keep polishing it and finally we published the game on App Store, Google Play and Taptap. <br/>

Team: Star Gazer Studio (Team of 6).
My Jobs: Game development, Game Release.
Tools Used: Unity.

## __1. Pixel Locker: A Decentralized Photography Auction Platform__   <br/>

### __Project Description:__
Today, people's copyrights for digital artworks cannot be protected easily because internet resources are actually controlled by small group of people and there is not really a consensus for the copyright of each artwork.

Now with the Blockchain technology, people's work can be permanently recorded, although admittedly the Blockchain technology has not been developed as well as centralized mode regarding to scalibility and security etc, it is a right direction and thought to really deal with intellectual properties in such a way.

The platform I am developing is for photographers to sell their works by auction, this is totally decentralized, no one has the control of copyrights of photographers including me, transactions are made through smart contracts deployed on blockchain, the history of a photograph is transparent to everyone so that duplicates and frauds can be effectively prevented. 

The project is built on Ethereum and all the transactions are made with "Ether".

Team: myself.
Award: UCI 2018 Blockchain Hackathon, the first place award.
